PropBank:
The  Penn  Proposition  Bank  focuses  on the argument structure of verbs,
and provides a    corpus    annotated    with    semantic    roles,
including   participants   traditionally   viewed   as   arguments and adjuncts.

An important goal is to provide consistent semantic role labels across different
syntactic realizations of the same verb, as in the window in [ARG0  John] broke
[ARG1  the  window]  and [ARG1  The  window]  broke.

Arg0 and Arg1 are used rather than the more traditional Agent and Patient to
keep the annotation as theory-neutral as possible, and to facilitate mapping
to richer representations.

The 1M word Penn Treebank II Wall Street Journal corpus has been successfully
annotated with semantic argument structures for verbs and  is  now available
via the Penn Linguistic Data Consortium as PropBank I (Palmer, et. al., 2005).
Coarse-grained sense tags, based on groupings of WordNet  senses,  are  being
added, as well as links from the argument labels in the Frames Files to FrameNet
frame  elements.

There are close parallels to other semantic role labeling  projects,
such as FrameNet (Baker,  et.  al.,  1998;  Fillmore  &  Atkins,  1998;
Fillmore  &  Baker,  2001),   Salsa   (Ellsworth,   et.al,   2004),
Prague Tectogrammatics (Hajicova  &  Kucerova,  2002)  and IAMTC, (Helmreich, et. al., 2004)
