Why would you use FrameNet when you have WordNet?

* The lexical information each contains is different,and in many ways complementary:
* FN has little to say about common nouns;
* WN noun hierarchies are usually good
* WN has little syntagmatic information, FN has a lot


| POS        | WordNet           | FrameNet  | VerbNet| PropBank |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| Noun      | 146,312 | 5,177 | | |
| Verb      | 25,047      |   4, 879 | | |
| Adjective | 30,002      |    2, 270 | | |
| Adverb | 5, 580      |    (other) 387 | | |
| Total | 206, 941    | 12, 713 | | |

### Structural differences - WordNet and FrameNet
* WN: separate hierarchies for N, V, Adj, and Adv., (only)!
* Each FN frame can cover words of any POS
* WN: hyper-/hyponymy relations between synsets (i.e. between LUs that are roughly synonymous)!
* FN: no LU relations per se, but several types of frame relations
* Content differences:!
* FN: annotated examples showing syntax and semantics of each LU.
* FN describes roles (Frame Elements) for each frame
* FN frame hierarchy often provides better generalizations than WN synset hierarchy
